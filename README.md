# Flight Experience Sentiment Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project aims to build an intelligent system capable of **predicting the sentiment of user comments about flight experiences**. For this purpose, a dataset from Kaggle was used, containing **real tweets from passengers** about flights with different airlines.

The ultimate goal is to develop a **production-ready web application** where users can share their opinions about their flights, and the system, using natural language processing (NLP) models, automatically classifies the comments as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

This way, airlines can use the collected information to:

- Monitor customer satisfaction in real-time.
- Identify areas for service improvement.
- Make data-driven decisions.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset was extracted from Kaggle and can be found at the following link:  
[Sentiment Analysis of Airline Tweets and Comments](https://www.kaggle.com/code/serkanp/sentiment-analysis-of-airline-tweets-and-comments)

It is a CSV file containing **15 columns** and **14,640 rows** of tweets from users sharing their flight experiences.

The key variables used in this project are:  
- **text**: The tweet text published by the user about their flight experience with a specific airline.  
- **airline_sentiment**: The target variable, which classifies the sentiment of the experience into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

These two variables are the core of the sentiment analysis modeling.
